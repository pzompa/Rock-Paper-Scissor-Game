## Design:
### Colour Scheme:
* The buttons are in bright aqua color to attract attention to  them and changes color to white on hover.
* The title of the game has a subtle black shadow which is appealing without being too loud.

### Typography:
* The main font used in this project is Golos. In case for any reason the Golos isn’t being imported correctly, Sans Serif is used as the fall back font. 
* Golos is aesthetically very appealing and appropriate for this game.

### Imagery:
* I used a galaxy background image to give it a mysterious and soothing effect on the user.
